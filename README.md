# umx Docker Image
This is a Docker container for R 4.1.0 with RStudio, [Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl?cid=sem43700010399172562&intel_term=%2Bintel%20%2Bmkl&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzcbWBRDmARIsAM6uChXqzD4ACUJqCiu3zRJKA9rkC31XOhm9lIkEYiwBITMR_8hJbIAExF8aAn_LEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), and `umx` package pre-installed. 

`umx` is a package designed to make [structural equation modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling) easier, from building, to modifying and reporting.
`umx` includes high-level functions for complex models such as multi-group twin models, as well as graphical model output.

## Docker Commands
### Pull umx image from dockerhub
```sudo docker pull diffpsych/umx```

### Run the umx container in detatched mode 
Map a host folder to the container so the container can access files on host and write out results. This is important since the --rm flag is there to tell the Docker Daemon to clean up the container and remove the file system after the container exits. Make sure you run the container as a non-root user.

`sudo docker run -d --rm -v $(pwd):/home/rstudio/data -e USERID=$UID -p 8787:8787 -e PASSWORD=<password> diffpsych/umx`

You can then open a web browser pointing to your docker host on port 8787. Username to login to RStudio is `rstudio` and the password is whatever you set when you ran the container.

### `docker run` and common [flags](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/):
  Argument           |  Explanation
  ------------------ | ----------------------    
  -i                 | Interactive (usually used with -t)
  -t                 | Give a terminal interface for a CLI
  -p                 | Publish Ports: `-p <host port>:<container port>`
  -d                 | Detached mode: run the container in the background (opposite of -i -t)
  -v                 | Mount a volume from inside your container (that has been specified with the VOLUME instruction in the Dockerfile)
  --rm               | Remove your container from the host when it stops running (only available with -it)

### See list of all running containers
```sudo docker ps```

### Kill running container
```sudo docker kill <container ID>```

## R Code

### Get or print the version of umx, along with detail from OpenMx and general system info
`umx::umxVersion()`

### Shows how many cores you are using, and runs a test script so user can check CPU usage
`umx::umx_check_parallel()`

### Set number of cores you want `umx` to use
`umx::umx_set_cores()` #if empty, shows number of available cores

### Benchmark your CPU and compare against other CPUs
`plot(benchmarkme::benchmark_std(runs=1))`
